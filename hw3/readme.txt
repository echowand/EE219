Project 3
==============================================
The programs are based on MATLAB R2016b. Matrix Factorization Toolbox and the
included wnmfrule function is needed to run the programs.

How to Run
==============================================
1. Unzip the folder and include all files in the path/working space

2. Run each .m file that correspond to repective problems.

Files
==============================================
data.mat: the processed version of u.data from MovieLens data sets

precisionAndRecall.m: calculates precision and recall of actual data and predictions

getPrecision.m: calculates precision

squareError.m  â€”-calculate square error between R and U*V

hitFalseAlarm.m: calculates hit rate and false alarm rate

part1.m: problem 1
part2.m: problem 2
part3.m: problem 3
part4.m: problem 4
part5.m: problem 5
